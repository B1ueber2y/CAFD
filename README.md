# CAFD
Class-Aware Frechet Distance (CAFD) for GANs in Tensorflow. Source code for "An Improved Evaluation Framework for Generative Adversarial Networks" \[[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07474.pdf)\].

# Dependencies
* python >= 3.5.0
* Tensorflow >= 1.4.0

# Download
You can manually download the domain-specific encoder and assign its path in `cafd.py`. 

* mnist.pb \[[GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KAfpbl08fTuoFaUM0Wr0fcbCMoBvQSW9/view?usp=sharing)\]
* fashion-mnist.pb \[[GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16SdetBp35q7C4InWiOPY9yOeq_0iMV09/view?usp=sharing)\]

Precalculated features for CAFD calculation are made available. 

* mnist.csv \[[GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LPzZWQVdX100rRyVC1hpFcBDJpu4BLj0/view?usp=sharing)\]
* fashion-mnist.csv \[[GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ky0cqkYu3yw0RCjwm0eMrQbwJYOkEtz-/view?usp=sharing)\]

# Usage
Different GAN models should be compared under the same encoder. 

To use CAFD, you can download the .pb model and assign its paths in `cafd.py`. Then, you can use
```
python cafd.py input1 input2
```
The input can be the path of either a folder containing generated images or a precalculated .csv features. 

You may use the precalculated features to test your model (take mnist for example):
```
python cafd.py mnist.csv path-to-your-folder
```
The folder contains the images generated by your GAN model.

# Experiments
* The folder `celebA` contains the code for Fig. 3 in the paper.

* The folder `mnist` contains the code for Fig. 5 in the paper.
